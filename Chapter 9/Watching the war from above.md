Watching the war from above

From his cave or rock shelter, the war is close enough to feel, far enough to be mostly unseen:

    On clear days he can see smoke on distant ridges—maybe a barn burned in reprisal, maybe a campfire from troops in the valley.

    Sometimes the distant thud of artillery reaches him as a faint, rolling boom that doesn’t sound like thunder.​​

    Columns of men move along the main road—tiny from his vantage point—blue and gray at different times, dust rising around them.

He watches:

    Patrols or foraging parties crossing creeks he used to baptize in, pausing at cabins where he once married couples.

    The way the hollow changes: fewer men in fields, more women and old folks doing heavy work, livestock thinned.

The war is without—visible below—but it has driven him into a war within.
Flashbacks: what’s being burned

Isolation gives him too much time to remember.

He sees, in his mind:

    Funerals he’s already done: small coffins for infants, long boxes for old men, graves cut into hill soil; now he imagines new rows that will be dug when this war is done.

    Conversions at brush‑arbor meetings: faces lit by lamplight, tears when people first believed they were loved by God; now he wonders if those same men are out there killing each other.

    Marriages on porches: vows spoken under summer sun, couples he urged to forgive quickly, share burdens; some of those husbands are gone, some widows will never see a body.

Each distant gunshot or rumor carried up to him by family overlays an old memory:

    “I baptized that boy in that creek; now someone is burying him by a road two counties away.”

    “I watched those brothers reconcile; now they might be on opposite sides of a battlefield, wearing different colors.”

The war is burning through the stories he helped create, and he feels the loss like personal amputation.
Three‑front battle: guilt, fear, faith

Inside, he fights on three fronts every day.

    Guilt: “I am not in the line of fire.”

    He knows other men his age or younger are marching, starving, bleeding.

    He wonders: “Am I a coward? Have I spiritualized what is really just fear?”

    When he hears about a death from his family—“they killed so‑and‑so’s boy”—he feels a stab: “I lived, he didn’t,” and it tastes like shame.

    Fear: “If they find me, they may punish my people too.”

    Every time voices pass below, he imagines dogs on his scent, boots coming up the slope.

    He’s less afraid of being shot than of what his capture would mean:

        Retaliation on his family for hiding him.

        His cave being used as proof that the hollow is “harboring traitors,” inviting harsher raids.

    This fear makes him hyper‑vigilant, flinching at every sound, sleeping lightly, heart racing at shadows.

    Faith: “What does God actually want from me?”

    He paces a few steps in the narrow cave, repeating verses aloud:

        “Resist not evil.”

        “Render unto Caesar…”

        “We must obey God rather than men.”

    He asks hard questions:

        “Is my duty to fight with a rifle or to intercede alone on this rock?”

        “Does God honor this refusal to kill, or am I burying my talent in the ground?”

        “If Christ walked this ridge, would He pick up a musket, or hide with me—or do something I can’t imagine?”

Some days he leans into:

    “I am here as an intercessor, a watcher on the wall; my sacrifice is this isolation and the misunderstanding of my own people.”

Other days, the darker thought wins:

    “I ran. I left them. I used my sermons as a shield, and now I sit in a cave while younger backs break and bodies fall.”

A man suspended between worlds

The chapter isn’t about him changing location; it’s about his inner terrain shifting:

    The cave becomes a monastery and a prison at once—place of prayer, place of self‑accusation.

    He has nothing to distract him from the question:

        “What does obedience look like when every worldly authority is demanding your blessing for its violence?”

He can’t solve it cleanly:

    On good days, he trusts that refusing to let God’s name be stamped on either flag is a holy act.

    On bad days, he fears God will say, “When your brothers were killed, you hid.”

That unresolved tension—the war outside and the war inside—sets up the emotional ground for the next chapter, when external gunfire finally stops and he has to decide whether, and how, to walk back down into the world he left.



In Chapter 9 – Watching the war from above:

    Emphasize the distance + helplessness: he sees smoke, hears cannon, but can’t intervene.

    Let him feel that strange guilt of watching other people’s suffering as shapes and sounds, not faces he can touch.

    Show him imagining what’s happening in detail because he only sees signals at a distance—like a person piecing together a story from flashes on a screen.

    Chapter 9 – Watching the war from above

    A note on the actual battles or campaigns that would be visible/audible from your ridge (even if unnamed in the chapter).

    Clarify how civilian observers experienced war “at a distance”: smoke on the horizon, roads jammed with wagons, refugees—not just battlefield gore.​

    If Kidd is wrestling with whether watching instead of fighting is moral, one note about how many rural Southerners aimed simply to survive, not to be “heroes.”
