“Say a word, Elisha”

It starts small and informal:

    A neighbor loses a child; the family is too shaken to find the traveling preacher in time. Someone says, “Elisha, you can say a word over him, can’t you?”

    A mid‑week prayer meeting runs dry, awkward silence stretching too long; faces turn toward him, expecting him to break it.

    When folks gather to clear land for a new cabin or barn, someone asks him to bless the work before the first tree falls.

He doesn’t have a title, but in practice:

    He’s the one who reads Scripture when nobody else can.

    He’s the one people ask to speak at the graveside, because he somehow names both the pain and the hope they can’t articulate.

The inside fight: God or pride?

Every time he’s asked, the same argument runs inside him:

    One voice: “This is God’s call. Ordinary men are all He’s ever really used out here.”

    The other: “You’re enjoying this too much. You like them listening. This is pride, not calling.”

So he:

    Tries to turn down invitations, hoping someone else will step up. When no one does, the silence feels worse than his fear, and he gives in.

    Punishes himself afterward—replays everything he said, hears every stumble, every moment that sounded too much like he was performing.

    Worries constantly about hypocrisy: he knows his own temper, doubts, petty grudges. How can someone like that speak for God?

At night:

    His Bible is worn not just from use but from wrestling—pages thumbed where he’s looking for reassurance that God actually calls men like him, and warnings about false teachers that he’s terrified might be about him.

A small congregation with no credentials

By the 1830s, the community’s need and habits make the next step almost inevitable:

    A neighbor donates land or a corner of a field for a simple log schoolhouse that doubles as a meeting place. On Sundays, benches and crude pulpit; on weekdays, slates and children.

    People start saying, not “When the preacher comes,” but “When Elisha speaks on Sunday.” They may not use the word “pastor,” but functionally, that’s what he is.

Visually:

    A rough wooden building, chinking between logs, maybe a single window. His pulpit is a plank across two stumps or a homemade lectern.

    His Bible is a family copy, possibly second‑hand, with faded print and a few pages torn—but it is the most authoritative object in the room.

    No robe, no collar: just his work clothes brushed off as best he can, boots cleaned, hair combed back, maybe a simple coat for Sunday.

He feels the gap constantly:

    He hears rumors of city preachers with seminary educations, Greek and Hebrew, printed sermons. All he has is what he’s seen, heard, and survived.

    When he stands up, he’s acutely aware that everyone knows his past—the time he lost his temper, the debts he struggled to pay, the years when he doubted.

    Yet, when he opens his mouth, the room leans forward; they’re not looking for polish, they’re looking for truth in their own accent.

This chapter is about that tension:

    He’s clearly been “called” in the only way mountain communities recognize—by use, by need, by fruit—while he carries a constant suspicion of his own motives. He is a preacher without papers, a shepherd with calloused hands, learning to accept that, in his world, that might be exactly the point.
