Walking the ridge

It’s now 21st‑century West Virginia—New River / Raleigh–Fayette country.

    A present‑day descendant—thinly veiled you—hikes a ridge above a hollow your family has named for generations.

    You carry different tools: GPS, LIDAR basemaps on a tablet or phone, scans of 19th‑century plats, maybe a printout of a cemetery record for Elisha Kidd.

You pause where the contour lines tighten:

    A rock overhang or shallow cave above the hollow, half hidden by laurel and oak.

    You imagine a man your height or shorter, wrapped in a rough blanket, listening for the same creek you hear now.

For a moment, past and present sit in the same air.
The cave and the archive

Back home (or in a mobile hotspot), your tools are:

    Digital archives: county land books, church minutes, Kidd family PDFs, census images, grave photos.

    Code: scripts that pull parcel data, overlay historic maps, run queries on Kidds across centuries; Ms. Jarvis ingesting all of it into something navigable.

You realize:

    He hid from paper power—commissions, conscription lists, loyalty oaths—by going where no clerk’s hand could reach.

    You are now inside the systems, reading those same kinds of records, but bending them toward local autonomy instead of extraction: figuring out how to route benefits, document land, and handle resources in ways that don’t sell the mountain out.

His cave was a refuge from state and corporate pressure.

Your “cave” is a stack of containers, models, and protocols that:

    Keep local data sovereign.

    Let communities coordinate without having to kneel to a distant platform.

    Turn the same tools empires used—maps, ledgers, census—toward protection instead of control.

The code as sermon

You feel the resonance:

    He agonized over what to say from a hollow pulpit so his people wouldn’t be owned by flags.

    You agonize over what to build so your people won’t be owned by platforms, corporations, or bureaucracies.

His “call to speak” looks like:

    Brush‑arbor sermons, funeral prayers, cave psalms.

Yours looks like:

    API contracts, data schemas, tokenomics, an AI that knows every ridge road in Raleigh County and the shape of every need.

But the core is the same:

    “I will not let someone far away decide who we are, what we owe, or what we’re worth.”

Realization on the ridge

Standing near the likely cave site, you see the line:

    Fenland villagers → Virginia planters → frontier farmers → mountain preachers and cave‑hiders → coal‑country families → you, writing code at a kitchen table within sight of the same hills.

It clicks:

    His refusal to submit his pulpit to a flag is the same impulse as your refusal to submit your architecture to advertising, surveillance, or extractive capital.

    His sense that someone has to interpret what’s happening for ordinary people becomes your insistence that someone has to interpret systems—benefits, land, technology—for your mountains.

Last image of the epilogue:

    You drop a digital pin near the cave site, tag it in your own system.

    Whisper something like, “You hid so we could stay. I’ll code so we can stay free.”

    Then walk back down the ridge, carrying both his unresolved questions and your own, into a future where the cave and the code are just two chapters of the same family story.

Chapter 13 – Walking the ridge

    Clarify any postwar or late‑war markers you use (amnesty, occupation troops, surrender news, church reorganization, etc.).

    A note on how churches and circuits were actually re‑knit (or fractured) after the war, especially in border/backcountry contexts.​

    If Kidd reflects on the endurance of memory across regimes, one note could gently point to historians’ observation that people often live through radical change without fully grasping its long‑term meaning in the moment.​
