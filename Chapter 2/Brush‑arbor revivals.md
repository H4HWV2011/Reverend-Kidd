Brush‑arbor revivals: sound, fear, and electricity

Brush arbors are rough, temporary “churches”:

    Men cut poles and saplings, lay a roof of brush, and spread straw or bare earth underfoot. Services run into the night.

    The atmosphere is thick: lantern light, insects, sweat, woodsmoke, and hymn‑singing that rises and falls like weather.

    Preachers hammer three themes over and over: hell is real, judgment is near, grace is offered now. People groan, shout, fall to their knees.

As a teenager, he stands at the edge:

    Torn between mocking it with other boys and being secretly shaken by how adults he respects are sobbing and going forward.

    The words “called,” “chosen,” “sinner,” and “saved” become daily vocabulary, not abstract theology.

The unwanted pull: “too poor, too ordinary”

Somewhere in this swirl, he begins to feel:

    A physical reaction when the preacher pauses: heart pounding, palms damp, a sense he should be the one saying something next.

    Deep resistance: “I’m not educated. I own nothing. I stutter when nervous. God picks other men, not me.”

    Fear that if he even admits the pull, people will assume he’s arrogant or crazy.

So he:

    Volunteers for safe roles—leading a hymn verse, reading a short scripture, helping set up benches—trying to serve without stepping over the line into “preacher.”

    Lies awake after meetings, replaying sermons in his head and composing his own in the dark, then feeling ashamed in the morning.

The first time he speaks

The turning point can be simple but seismic:

    A neighbor dies unexpectedly—a child, a young mother, an old man he worked with. The regular preacher is away, or the family asks him to say a few words because “you always talk about the Bible.”

    Or at the end of a revival night, the preacher calls for “someone here” to pray aloud, and silence falls too long.

He steps forward:

    His voice shakes, the first sentences are clumsy. He maybe misquotes a verse or mixes King James phrases out of order.

    But he speaks from what he knows: hard soil, long winters, fear of not feeding your children, the feel of a coffin lid on rough boards.

    People who’ve known him all his life go still—not because it’s polished, but because it sounds like them but with hope added.

Afterward:

    An older woman grips his arm and says, “The Lord’s got hold of you.”

    A man who never cries wipes his eyes and walks off quickly.

    He feels both relief and terror: something that was private is now public; he can’t fully go back to being just another boy in the back row.

That’s the heart of this chapter:

    The brush‑arbor becomes not just a place he visits, but the stage where he discovers that his voice has weight—and that answering that pull is going to cost him the safety of being ordinary.
