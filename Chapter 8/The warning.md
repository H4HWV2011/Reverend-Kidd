The warning

After the “refusing the flag” sermon, pressure hardens into danger:

    A sympathetic neighbor—maybe someone with kin in a patrol—comes to the cabin at dusk:

        “Preacher, they’re talking about you in town.”

        “A man said, ‘If he won’t pray for us, maybe we should shut his mouth ourselves.’”

        Or more directly: “They aim to take one of your boys if they can’t get you.”

    He looks at his sons—young, strong, draft‑age—and sees, suddenly, targets instead of just children.

A private conversation with his wife:

    She says what he’s already thinking: “If they haul you off, who will bury our people? Who will keep the boys from going, just to defend your honor?”

    The conclusion comes with awful clarity: him staying visible might cost more lives than him disappearing.

Choosing the cave

The decision isn’t dramatic; it’s quiet and heavy:

    They know the land above the hollow intimately—ledges, rock overhangs, small caves half‑hidden by laurel and rhododendron.

    Together, they pick a spot: high enough to see the hollow and the road, hidden enough that a patrol would walk under it without knowing he’s there.

He packs:

    A blanket or two, maybe a thin straw tick if they can manage.

    A Bible, a small knife, a flint or matches, a tin cup.

    No gun, or a very small one, because carrying arms could change him from “preacher hiding” to “armed rebel” in the eyes of whoever finds him.

At first light or after dark, he goes up:

    He does not preach a goodbye sermon; that would draw attention.

    Instead, there’s a last hug at the cabin door, a whispered prayer over his wife and children, and then he walks into the tree line like a man going to his own funeral.

Life in the cave: cold, hunger, listening

Day‑to‑day in hiding is punishing and slow.

    Cold:

        Even with a small fire carefully shielded, the rock sucks warmth from his bones.

        In bad weather he wakes with frost in his beard, fingers numb, legs cramped from trying to stay small and invisible.

    Hunger:

        Food comes irregularly—cornbread wrapped in cloth, a strip of bacon, a jar of beans.

        He rations mercilessly, eating just enough to stay upright. On thin days he chews on scripture and memory more than anything.

    Water and body:

        He creeps to a seep, spring, or small run when he’s sure no one is watching.

        Bathing is rare; he smells of smoke, sweat, and damp stone.

    Listening:

        He spends long stretches lying still, listening for dogs, boots, or voices on the trail below.

        A snapped twig can mean game, family, or armed men; his heart doesn’t distinguish until he’s sure.

Time becomes strange:

    Days marked by the sound of axes in far hollows, roosters down below, distant gunshots, or the rumble of troops on a road he can’t quite see.

    Nights marked by the change in wind, the cry of owls, the crackle of his own tiny fire.

Family as lifeline

Family members thread the gap between the hollow and the cave:

    A son or daughter, carrying a basket “to gather berries” or “check the trap line,” detours to his hideout.

    His wife sends not just food but news:

        “They came through yesterday, asking questions, but they’re gone now.”

        “Mrs. So‑and‑so’s boy was taken to fight.”

        “Old man Jenkins died; they asked where you were, we said you were away visiting kin.”

They have to act as if he’s gone whenever patrols or outsiders ask—“Has anyone seen the Reverend?” → “Not in weeks.” That requires lying to power while telling the truth to him, a moral knot he helps them navigate with whispered prayers.

Each visit is brief:

    A hug, a few fast sentences, maybe a shared prayer whispered in a cramped space.

    Then the messenger goes back down alone, leaving him with echoes.

His inner war

In the cave, he fights battles no one sees:

    Guilt: “I’ve left them to face this without me.” “Men younger than me are dying while I hide.”

    Defiance: “I will not bless a war I believe will damn these hills.” “I’d rather live in this hole than let them use my pulpit.”

    Prayer: He prays not like a pulpit man, but like a fugitive—short, desperate, honest:

        For his family’s safety.

        For boys in both uniforms.

        For the hollow not to tear itself apart.

He flips his Bible pages with cracked fingers, hovering over psalms of hiding and deliverance:

    “Thou art my hiding place.”

    “He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High…”

Those words no longer feel like metaphor—they feel like topography.

This chapter is about:

    A man who refused to let any flag own his conscience, now living like a hunted animal so the people he loves can go on living. The cave is both prison and sanctuary—his choice to go to ground keeps the line alive, even as it nearly breaks him.
