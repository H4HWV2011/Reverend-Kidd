Setting: Backcountry Virginia childhood

He’s born in 1808, in what is still Virginia, before West Virginia exists.

    Home: A log cabin on a slope above a creek—corn patch out front, a few hogs, maybe a cow, a small orchard if his father is ambitious. The house is smoke‑dark inside, with pallets near the fire in winter.

    Work: From very young, he’s hoeing corn, fetching water, carrying wood, watching older men fell trees and burn brush. Schooling, if any, is seasonal and minimal; most education is work, Bible, and stories.

    Noise: Axes, animal calls, creek sound, wind in the trees. Sunday quiet is noticeable because the work slows, and neighbors travel on rough paths to meet.

First encounters with traveling preachers and camp meetings

In the 1810s–1820s, the Second Great Awakening is in full swing across frontier regions.

    A circuit rider—Baptist or Methodist—comes on a horse, wet cloak, saddlebags full of tracts and maybe a worn Bible. He’s the most educated man many will see for months.

    A brush‑arbor meeting gets called: men cut poles, lay branches for a roof, and people gather from scattered hollows for preaching, singing, and sometimes days‑long revivals.

    He watches:

        Adults crying, shouting “Amen,” going forward when the preacher calls sinners to repentance.

        The preacher telling poor farmers that God sees them directly, without needing a rich church or a bishop.

        Baptist or Methodist language about conversion, new birth, and personal decision, very different from older Anglican/established patterns.

The sensory world:

    Smoky lanterns or torches, hymns sung in shape notes or by call‑and‑response.

    Horses tied in the trees around the arbor, children half‑bored, half‑curious.

    Women in faded calico wiping tears as the preacher describes hell, then grace.

Watching his father’s generation argue about “real religion” and the new America

His father and uncles grew up in the immediate post‑Revolution era, when:

    The old Church of England establishment was dismantled, and with it the idea that religion comes only from formal clergy and parish structures.

    New sects and denominations competed: Baptists, Methodists, “New Light” Presbyterians, and various independent groups.

Around the fire and at fence lines, he hears:

    Arguments over whether these new preachers are “sent from God” or “just noise and show.”

    Fights over baptism (infant vs. believer), communion, and whether dancing and drinking are acceptable.

    Talk about America as a chosen nation, God judging or blessing the new republic, and what that means for plain people in the hills.

For a boy like him, this means:

    Religion isn’t a silent background; it’s alive, contested, and personal.

    He sees that words have power: what a preacher says can split families or mend them, spark revivals or start feuds.

    Somewhere in this mix, he feels both drawn and scared—drawn to the way words move people, scared of the weight that would put on whoever stands up front.
