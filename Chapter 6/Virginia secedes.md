Virginia secedes, and the mountains grumble

In 1861, word comes that Virginia has voted to secede from the Union.​​

    In Richmond and the Tidewater, many celebrate; in the mountains, the reaction is muted and mixed.

    Around him, he hears:

        “If Virginia goes, we go with her—state first.”

        “Richmond never did much for us but tax us; why should our boys die for their slaves?”

    In courthouse towns, secession flags go up. In the hollow, life looks the same at first—fields still need planting, cabins still need roofing—but there’s a new tension in every conversation.

Western counties (what will become West Virginia) begin to murmur dissent:

    Meetings in towns talk about staying loyal to the Union even if Richmond leaves.

    Men ride through spreading news of “Restored Government” and the possibility of a new state.​

To the Reverend, this feels like watching your own family split—same land, same rivers, now different allegiances.
Young men pulled toward uniforms—or away from them

The hollow’s boys, including his own sons and nephews, are in the crosshairs:

    Confederate recruiters come first—officers or local men carrying commissions, promising honor, pay, and defense of home.

    Union recruiters or sympathizers show up later or move more quietly, especially as federal forces gain footholds in western Virginia.​

Each young man faces a triangle of options:

    Join the Confederacy – often framed as defending Virginia and Southern rights.

    Join the Union – framed as defending the old flag and the idea of the United States.

    Join neither – stay home, dodge conscription, or vanish into the hills.

At kitchen tables and under trees, the Reverend hears:

    Mothers begging sons to stay out of it.

    Sons saying they can’t live with themselves if they don’t answer some call to arms.

    Men arguing over whether God is more on the side of “liberty” or “order,” “Union” or “state rights.”

He’s asked, explicitly:

    “Preacher, what does God want me to do?”

    He knows that a simple “Yes, go,” or “No, stay” could set a course toward a grave or a lifelong wound.

The first funeral of a boy in uniform

Inevitably, news comes back:

    A boy from the hollow—someone he’s baptized, watched grow, maybe scolded for skipping chores—dies in uniform.

    The details are vague: “killed near some place we never heard of,” or “died in hospital,” but the effect lands like a cannon blast in the hollow.

The funeral is different from any he’s done before:

    The family may place a piece of uniform, a hat, or a ribbon on the coffin if the body made it home; sometimes there’s only a symbolic casket or a grave marker with no remains.

    Neighbors crowd in; some wear homemade Confederate badges, others stand bare‑pinned, silently insisting on their difference.

    The air is packed with more than grief: anger, pride, guilt, fear, all sitting on benches together.

When he stands to preach:

    He knows every word will be weighed:

        If he praises the boy as a hero of one cause, he alienates those on the other side.

        If he speaks only of heaven and avoids mentioning the war, people will hear cowardice or evasion.

    He chooses, perhaps, a text like “Blessed are the peacemakers” or “No man hath greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,” but carefully disconnects it from politicians’ slogans.

As he speaks:

    Some hear comfort: your son is seen by God, not just by armies.

    Some hear offense: that he refused to call the cause itself righteous.

    Everyone hears that the war is no longer “out there”—it has a grave in their own soil now.

After the service:

    A father might grip his hand too hard and whisper, “Thank you.”

    Another man might walk away stiffly, deciding the preacher is not “sound” enough politically.

    He goes home with a new, heavy knowledge: from now on, every sermon is a war sermon, whether he likes it or not.

This chapter shows:

    The moment when the line that split Virginia also splits his congregation and his own calling. He is still trying to speak as a shepherd of souls, while the world is demanding he choose a side as a loyal subject.


Chapter 6 – Virginia secedes

    Timeline note: secession convention, Fort Sumter, Lincoln’s call for troops, then Virginia’s decision.

    Brief clarification of the geographic and class split inside Virginia (east vs west, slave vs less‑slaveholding counties) that foreshadows West Virginia.

    If Kidd’s loyalties are complicated, a note that many clergy and laypeople were genuinely torn, not uniformly pro‑Confederate or pro‑Union.
