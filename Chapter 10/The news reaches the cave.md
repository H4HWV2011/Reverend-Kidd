By 1865, the external war stops with a sentence; the internal war he’s been fighting lurches into a new phase.
The news reaches the cave

It doesn’t come as a trumpet blast; it comes on tired lips:

    A son, wife, or trusted neighbor climbs up and says something simple like:

        “They say Lee surrendered at Appomattox.”

        “Men are going home. The armies are breaking up.”

        “They’ve gone and made West Virginia its own state now, and it’s holding.”​​

    His first reaction isn’t joy; it’s disbelief mixed with dread:

        “If the war’s over, what have I done with these years?”

        “Who’s still alive down there?”

He waits a few days, listening:

    Patrol traffic thins. Fewer gunshots, fewer shouted orders.

    Sounds of normal life—axes, cows, children—begin to swell again beneath the ridge.

Finally, the sense settles: staying up here now would be hiding from life, not from war.
The walk back down

Coming down the mountain is physically easy, emotionally brutal:

    His body has grown used to the cave; the first steps into open sunlight feel exposed.

    The path he knew by heart now feels different—trees cut, undergrowth trampled, a new track cut by wagons.

    As he approaches the edge of cleared land, he sees:

        Fences down, fields overgrown or poorly tended.

        Houses patched with mismatched boards, signs of hurried repairs after raids.

        Fewer men than he remembers; more gray in the hair of those who remain.

At his own cabin:

    There’s a tight, quiet reunion: embrace, tears, long silence.

    Children or grandchildren who were small when he left now stand taller, half‑strangers.

    His wife’s face carries new lines—years of holding everything together without him.

Meeting the eyes of those who fought

The hardest part is meeting his neighbors:

    Men who went to war—in blue or gray—have scars, missing limbs, or haunted eyes.

    Widows and parents have black ribbons and empty chairs around their tables.

Reactions split:

    Some welcome him warmly:

        “We’re glad you lived, preacher. We need you now more than ever.”

    Others are restrained, polite but distant:

        “You found a safe spot, I hear.”

        “We were out there; you were up there.”

    A few might not speak at all, just turn away—unable or unwilling to reconcile his absence with their suffering.

He feels all of it:

    Gratitude that anyone still wants him.

    A knife of shame from those who don’t.

    A deeper awareness that nothing he says can erase or fully redeem these years.

Quiet rebuilding, not triumphant revival

There is no grand “welcome back” service; instead, there’s slow, practical reconstruction:

    Fences mended:

        He and others spend days resetting posts, re‑stringing rails, repairing gates so livestock won’t wander.

        Hands cut and blistered, conversations thin but honest: “Sorry about your boy.” “We heard you were with such‑and‑such regiment.”

    Fields replanted:

        They put seed in ground that has seen soldiers march and skirmish across it.

        He helps with plowing when he can, side by side with men who may still doubt him.

    Church gatherings resumed:

        The first meeting back is small, awkward. People sit farther apart than before, eyes watching him and each other.

        He doesn’t announce his return with fanfare; he just opens the Bible, reads, and prays, voice a little rough from disuse.

His sermons now:

    Focus on lament and healing—psalms of loss, promises of God binding up the broken‑hearted.

    Avoid easy explanations—he refuses to say any side “won for God”; he speaks instead of God surviving the nations’ madness.

    Invite people to confess grief and bitterness, not just personal sins.

A changed shepherd for a changed flock

Both he and the hollow are different:

    He has known absolute vulnerability and silence; this makes his words slower, less eager to judge.

    The hollow has tasted blood, hunger, and betrayal; this makes people less impressed by rhetoric, more attuned to who shows up and who doesn’t.

Over time:

    The awkwardness softens. People start bringing him their pain again: “My husband wakes screaming,” “I can’t forgive the man who turned in my boy,” “I don’t know how to worship after this.”

    He becomes, slowly, not just the man who “hid in a cave” but the one who walked back down and stayed through the long, dull work of mending what war left.

This chapter’s energy is quiet but powerful:

    No parades, no vindication—just a man stepping back into a broken community, carrying both the stain and the strength of what he did, and choosing to spend the rest of his years helping those hills remember how to live without gunfire.
