A circuit stitched by boots and creek crossings

His “parish” isn’t a neat map; it’s:

    A string of cabins and small clearings along creeks and ridges—some a short walk away, others a half‑day ride over rough trails.

    He keeps a kind of mental map: who lives at the head of which hollow, who is sick, who is fighting, who hasn’t been seen at meeting in too long.

Week by week:

    He walks or rides from home to home, Bible wrapped in cloth, maybe a small notebook and pencil if he can afford it.

    No steeples or church bells—just porches, yards, and creek banks where people gather when word spreads that “the preacher is coming.”

Baptisms in creeks and marriages on porches

The sacraments happen in ordinary spaces:

    Baptisms:

        Men and women step into cold creek water, sometimes breaking thin ice in early spring.

        He wades in with them, clothes soaked, arm around shivering shoulders, and lowers them under while neighbors sing from the bank.

        Mud, water, and heaven all mixed together.

    Marriages:

        He stands on a plank porch, couple in their best clothes (which might just mean clean and patched instead of dirty and patched).

        A few neighbors witness; a fiddler might play later, but the ceremony itself is simple—vows in plain language, a prayer, and a handshake.

        He writes the names and date in a small book or on a loose paper that might be the only legal record they’ll ever have.

Every life passage in the hollow runs through his hands: births blessed, marriages joined, deaths commended.
Plow in one hand, Bible in the other

He is not a full‑time clergyman; he’s a working farmer:

    All week, he’s plowing, planting, mending fences, cutting wood, tending animals.

    He snatches study time whenever he can: a psalm read at midday rest, a chapter of the New Testament by lamplight after chores.

    His sermons are built from what he can memorize or jot on scraps, hauled in his head across hills.

On Sunday:

    He rises before dawn, does the essential chores, then cleans up as much as the week allows—maybe changing into his one decent shirt and coat.

    Walks or rides to the log schoolhouse or home where services are held that day, arriving dusted with trail and weather.

    Preaches, prays, listens, then often stays after to hear private worries: sick children, failing crops, marital fights.

He lives close to exhaustion most weeks, but there is a quiet satisfaction: the sense that his entire life—work and words—is one piece.
Quiet influence: the hollow’s conflict‑solver and comforter

His power isn’t in titles; it’s in small, repeated acts:

    Mediating feuds:

        Two neighbors won’t speak; a property line or livestock issue turned personal. He visits each, listens without taking sides, then brings them together on a porch or under a tree.

        Uses parables and shared scripture to frame compromise: “Blessed are the peacemakers” lands differently when spoken by a man who helped both of them bury family.

    Praying over sick children:

        When a child burns with fever or coughs all night, parents send for him after they’ve done all they know—herbs, poultices, hope.

        He comes, sits by the bed, places a rough hand on a small forehead, and prays—not magic, but witness: “You’re not alone; God sees this.”

        Sometimes the child lives; sometimes he doesn’t. Either way, the family remembers who came and stayed.

    Burying babies and old men:

        He stands in tiny clearings at the edge of fields, at family graveyards on knolls.

        Says the words no one else can bring themselves to say: names, dates, the fact of death, and the hope of something beyond it.

        His voice becomes the soundtrack of grief for the hollow; when people remember their losses, they hear his prayers.

This chapter is about showing:

    He isn’t famous, rich, or formally trained. But over years, his footsteps, words, and presence knit together a scattered people. He becomes “the hollow’s shepherd” not by decree, but by showing up, again and again, wherever the creek bends and a door opens.
