Two flags, one hollow

After secession and early battles, both sides start treating the New River / western Virginia region as contested ground.​​

    Local Confederate “Committees of Safety” and officers want everyone—especially visible men like preachers—to declare for the South.

    As Union forces gain hold and West Virginia moves toward statehood, Union officers, scouts, and local Unionists want the same: a public statement that he’s for the old flag.​

His hollow becomes a place where:

    Confederate patrols might come this week, demanding food, information, and loyalty.

    Union scouts or raiders might come next week, asking who supports Richmond and who is hiding men in the hills.

He sees clearly: whatever flag he blesses, the other can mark him—and his family—as an enemy.
The pressure: “Preacher, pick a side”

It starts with “polite” pressure:

    A Confederate officer attends service, sits in front, and afterwards says, “Reverend, perhaps you’d like to speak a word from the pulpit next Sunday about our sacred cause.”

    A deacon whispers that it would be “good for the church” if he’d lead a prayer for victory for Virginia.

Later, Union men or local Unionists say:

    “If you’re loyal to the true government, you’ll say so when you stand up there.”

    “The people need to know their preacher’s not for rebellion.”

At home and in visits, ordinary people join the chorus:

    “If you don’t speak up, folks will think you’re against us.”

    “If you do speak up, the others will come for you.”

For him, each of these requests is not just political; it’s a demand to weaponize his calling.
The sermon that refuses both banners

He wrestles for days: Bible open, sleep thin. Sections he can’t escape:

    Israel’s prophets refusing to rubber‑stamp kings.

    Jesus refusing to be pulled into Zealot vs. Roman lines, yet speaking judgment on both hypocrisy and empire.

Finally, he decides: he will preach, but not the sermon either side wants.

On Sunday:

    The room is packed—word has spread that “he’s going to address the war.” Men in partial uniforms, others with home‑made badges, some with arms crossed tight.

    He chooses a text about two kingdoms: one of this world, one not; or about loving enemies and serving God rather than men.

He says, in effect:

    That no earthly flag is the Kingdom of God.

    That no government, North or South, holds a perfect claim on Christian conscience.

    That men must examine their hearts before God, not just shout slogans.

    That he will pray for the souls of all involved, but will not declare God’s blanket endorsement of either government’s cause.

He might add something like:

    “I will pray for the wounded, the grieving, the fearful, the captives, and the dying—on both sides. I will bury your sons and your enemies’ sons. But this pulpit will not be an altar for any flag.”

Fallout: coward, traitor, or true shepherd?

The silence after is heavy.

Reactions splinter:

    Some old‑timers nod slowly: they recognize integrity, even if they’re scared of the consequences.

    Hardliners on either side feel betrayed:

        “He won’t stand up for his state; he’s a coward.”

        “He won’t stand up for the Union; he’s soft on rebels.”

    Whispers begin:

        At the well: “He’s no patriot.”

        In cabins: “Maybe he’s hiding his true colors.”

        In more dangerous mouths: “Men like that are a danger. If he won’t help us, maybe he’s helping them.”

He goes home knowing:

    He has kept his conscience, refusing to make God’s name a tool for any army.

    He has also painted a target on himself and, worse, possibly on his family and flock.

This chapter marks the crisis of conscience:

    He has formally refused to let the pulpit become a flagstand. From this point on, it’s only a matter of time before one or both sides decide that a man who won’t bless their banner is safer in a cave—or a grave—than in a hollow full of impressionable souls.



    Chapter 7 – “Two flags” / pressure to declare

        When men argue over what he “must” say, focus on how each group only hears the part of his sermons that confirms what they already believe.

        That selective listening is the historical form of information silo—no commentary needed.
