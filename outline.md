# Reverend Kidd
Here’s a lean chapter outline you could use for a novel loosely based on **Rev. William Elisha Kidd’s** life.

***

## 1. The Boy in the Holler (1808–1820s)

- Birth into a backcountry Virginia family; cabin, hillside fields, creek.  
- First encounters with traveling preachers and camp meetings.  
- Watching his father’s generation argue about “real religion” and the new America.

***

## 2. Voices in the Brush Arbor (Teen Years)

- Local revivals under brush arbors; ecstatic worship, fear of hell, promise of grace.  
- He feels an uninvited pull to speak, but fights it—too poor, too ordinary.  
- First time he stands up to pray or testify in front of neighbors.

***

## 3. Called Without Credentials (Young Man, 1830s)

- Community starts asking him to “say a word” at funerals, prayer meetings.  
- Internal struggle: Is this God, or just pride?  
- First small congregation in a schoolhouse or log church; rough Bible, no formal training.

***

## 4. The Hollow’s Shepherd (Building a Ministry)

- Circuit of cabins and hollows he serves: baptisms in creeks, marriages on porches.  
- Balancing farm labor with preaching—plowing all week, riding out Sundays.  
- Quiet influence: mediating feuds, praying over sick children, burying babies and old men.

***

## 5. Rumors of War (1850s)

- News of Kansas, Dred Scott, John Brown trickling into the mountains.  
- Arguments in the congregation about slavery, Union, and state rights.  
- He tries to preach repentance and unity while people start choosing sides.

***

## 6. When the Line Splits (Secession and 1861)

- Virginia votes to secede; western counties murmur dissent.  
- Young men from his community pulled toward enlistment—Confederate, Union, or neither.  
- First funeral of a boy from the hollow killed in uniform; sermon everyone listens to too hard.

***

## 7. Refusing the Flag (Crisis of Conscience)

- Pressure from local Confederate officers or Committees of Safety to declare loyalty.  
- Pressure from Union sympathizers or raiders later to do the same.  
- He preaches a sermon that refuses to bless either side outright—congregation divided, whispers that he’s a coward or a traitor.

***

## 8. To the Cave (Going to Ground)

- Threats become explicit: someone warns him they’re coming for him, or for his sons.  
- He disappears into a cave / rock shelter above the hollow.  
- Daily life in hiding: cold, hunger, listening for dogs and voices; family members sneaking him food and news.

***

## 9. The War Without and Within

- From the cave, he hears distant cannon, sees smoke on ridges, watches patrols on the road.  
- Flashbacks to earlier funerals, conversions, marriages—what the war is burning.  
- Wrestles with guilt (not fighting), fear (being caught), and faith (what God expects of him).

***

## 10. Ashes and Return (1865)

- Word reaches him: Lee surrendered, armies dissolving, West Virginia now a state.  
- He walks back down into the hollow; awkward reception from neighbors who fought.  
- Quiet rebuilding: fences mended, fields replanted, church gatherings resumed in damaged communities.

***

## 11. Coal and the New Masters (Postwar Years)

- Rail surveyors and company men start appearing; land agents asking about mineral rights.  
- Young men drawn from farms into timber and early coal work.  
- He watches a new system—corporate instead of plantation or army—take hold of the mountains.

***

## 12. Old Man on the Ridge (Late Life, 1870s–1890)

- Aging preacher reflecting on three regimes: old Virginia, the war years, the coal age.  
- Counseling younger preachers and kin; passing stories (including the cave) to grandchildren.  
- Final illness and death; burial on a hillside cemetery, simple stone, stories handed down around kitchen tables.

***

## 13. Epilogue: The Cave and the Code (Modern Frame)

- Present‑day descendant (thinly veiled you) walking the same ridge, looking for the cave.  
- Using maps, archives, and code (Ms. Jarvis / MountainShares) to honor and extend what he tried to do: keep mountain people free and connected under their own values.  
- Realization: his “refusal to submit” and “call to speak” are still alive, just in a different medium.

You can compress or expand these, but this arc gives you:

- A **spiritual coming‑of‑age**,  
- A **war‑era hiding act**, and  
- A **transition into the coal/modern world**,  

all anchored in one man’s life and the land your family never left.
