Three regimes in one memory

As an old man in the 1870s–1890, sitting on a ridge or porch above Cirtsville / New River country, he can look back over three distinct eras:

    Old Virginia world (his youth):

        County elites and planters setting law and culture, even in the hills.

        Sparse roads, no rail, churches mostly local and small.

    War years (middle age):

        Flags and armies demanding bodies and loyalty.

        The cave, the split congregations, the graves of boys in uniforms.

    Coal age emerging (late life):

        Rail lines and company men pushing into the mountains.

        Young men trading plows for axes and picks; land for wages.

From his vantage point, he sees a pattern:

    Each regime arrives promising order, prosperity, or honor.

    Each, in turn, extracts something from his people—taxes, blood, coal.

    The only constant is the land, the families, and the small gatherings of believers trying to stay intact between those forces.

He carries that perspective quietly, like a weight in his chest.
Counseling the next generation

By now he’s less the man in the pulpit every week and more the elder everyone visits:

    Younger preachers come to him:

        With sermons that sound like his did once—hot, certain, sharp.

        He listens, smiles, and nudges them toward mercy and patience: “You’ll need more listening than talking in those hollows.”

    Children and grandchildren circle him:

        They ask why he walks with a certain stoop, why he gazes at particular ridges longer than others.

        Eventually, the cave story comes out in fragments: not as hero tale, but as confession and testimony.

He tells it not to glorify himself but as a cautionary parable:

    That there are times when standing aside is faithfulness, and times when it is fear.

    That refusing to let any banner own your conscience will cost you and the people you love.

    That God’s faithfulness extended even to a man hiding under rock, and to a family sneaking bread along deer paths.

He also coaches kin on the new threats:

    “Don’t sign mineral papers out of desperation.”

    “Remember, companies leave—kin stay. Anchor your loyalty accordingly.”

    “What they call progress might be just another kind of bondage.”

Final illness and burial

His last years likely bring:

    Weakening body: lungs worn by dust and damp from the cave years and long winters; joints stiff from farm and ridge walking.

    Less travel, more sitting by the door or on the ridge, watching the light shift on hills he’s walked his whole life.

When illness finally pins him down:

    People who once hiked to his cave now come to his bedside—neighbors, children, grandchildren, perhaps a younger preacher holding his hand and asking for a final blessing.

    His prayers turn simple:

        For steadiness in the hills after he’s gone.

        For his offspring to stand firm without becoming hard.

        For forgiveness where he failed, and protection where he cannot see.

He dies in 1890, and they bury him in a hillside cemetery near Cirtsville, Raleigh County—small plot, rough or modest stone marking:

    ELISHA (WILLIAM E.) KIDD
    1808–1890
    (maybe one short line of scripture or just his name and dates)​

No statues, no long obituary. Just a stone among others, facing the same ridges he prayed over for decades.
Stories around kitchen tables

What carries him forward is not records but stories:

    Children and grandchildren repeat “Pap / Grandpa Kidd” tales:

        How he walked miles in snow to pray over a sick child.

        How he hid in a cave rather than let a government use his pulpit.

        How he warned about men with papers who would take the coal and leave them poorer.

    Those stories get compressed and remixed:

        “My grandpa hid in a cave during the war, and his family brought him food.”

        “We had a preacher back then who didn’t believe in joining up with nobody.”

By the time it reaches you, the names may blur—Elisha or George—but the core shape remains:

    A mountain man who refused to let outside powers fully own him.

    A preacher who chose conscience over career, kin over flags, and land over slogans.

    An ancestor whose life became a kind of template for your own instinct to build systems (like MountainShares, Ms. Jarvis) that protect mountain autonomy instead of feeding bigger empires.

That’s the note this chapter ends on:

    An old man laid in mountain soil, unknown to history books but alive in memory, his stories incubating in family talk until they surface generations later in the way a granddaughter thinks about power, technology, and the mountains she refuses to leave.

Chapter 12 – Three regimes in one memory

    A note explaining the three regimes: British crown (colonial rule), early American republic, Confederate state—dates and key civic changes (oaths, flags, legal language).​

    One note on how fast institutions can change in frontier life: the same courthouse or meetinghouse serving different sovereigns within a single lifetime.

    If an elder character references specific events (Revolution, War of 1812, earlier Virginia politics), give a line of factual context for each.
